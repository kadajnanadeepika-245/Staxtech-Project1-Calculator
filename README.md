# 🧮 Smart Calculator – Java Swing

🎯 **Project 1 – Developed during my internship at [StaxTech]**

A fully-featured **Smart Calculator** application built using **Java Swing**. This project supports not only basic arithmetic operations but also scientific calculations, constants, and memory features. Designed with a clean GUI and built using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
